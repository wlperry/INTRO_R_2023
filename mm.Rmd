# This is a markdown document.

## There are different headers.

### and you can do a lot of different things.

-   bullet list
-   second
-   third
-   fourth

or a number list

1.  stuff
2.  more stuff
3.  more and more stuff

and we can make a graph

```{r}
mm.df <- read_csv("data/mms.csv")
head(mm.df)
```

### now we can do a plot of data

```{r}
mm.df %>% 
  filter(center=="plain") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(diameter, mass, color = center)) +
  geom_point()
```
